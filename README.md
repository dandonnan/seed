# Seed

While the repository is set to public, it is advised not to use any of these libraries as they aren't
finished - the MonoGame libraries currently don't build and the Unity package is experimental.

The intent is for these to be usable at somepoint in the near future, but it has only been made public
at this point so the Unity package can be installed from a central location instead of locally.
