# Seed

After continuously starting projects and then abandoning them after setting up some of the
non-gamey stuff, **Seed** was created to bring together these abandoned backbones so that
projects could be started with them already there.

## MonoGame
The **MonoGame** part of Seed consists of some class libraries that can be imported into
a MonoGame project, as well as a wizard that can create a new game solution and integrate
specific parts of Seed directly into it.

## Unity
The **Unity** part of Seed is a class library that can be used within a Unity project.
