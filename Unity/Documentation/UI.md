# UI

## Controller Icon
The **Controller Icon** is a script that can be applied to display a controller icon prompt that is
relevant to the current input method. If the input method changes, the icon will also change. The
script must be attached to an object that has an **Image** component, as this is used to display
the icon.

The **Button Type** dropdown will determine which icon is displayed.
